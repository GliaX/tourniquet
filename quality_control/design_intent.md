# Design intent

## Plastic selection - do not use PLA
ABS and PETG are acceptable materials to use to print the plastic parts of the tourniquet. PLA is not an acceptable material because it does not withstand exposure to UV light or exposure to the elements well.

## Windlass shape
The windlass must remain cylindrical in shape. This shape does present some inconvenience while printing but this is unavoidable. Support material should be used when printing. Putting a flat face on the windlass will cause the effective diameter of the windlass to not be constant during tightening of the tourniquet. This adds multiple seconds to the time required to apply the tourniquet which is unacceptable.

## Do not change the clip thickness
If the thickness of the clip is changed it will negatively impact the ability of the windlass to secure properly.

## Keep the backing plate and clip separate.
This is important to accommodate small limb sizes. Keeping the parts separate makes them easier to print and allows them to be printed in the orientation best suited to each part.

## Use sections of different lengths of hook and loop instead of one length.
This allows the TQ to dependably catch on itself when applied one-handed as it avoids the scenario where loop meets loop and hook meets hook. However, if using Omnitape then hook and loop exists throughout the entire length of the tape and sectioning is not necessary.

## Adhere to the inner-strap-through-windlass length when assembling.
Changing this length negatively impacts the ability of the windlass to apply effective pressure to against a limb.

## Metal is not necessary for the windlass.
A metal windlass is not necessary and attempting to add metal to a plastic windlass increases complexity without providing any useful benefit. Making the windlass stronger is unnecessary as the windlass is generally one of the last failure points on the tourniquet.

## Nylon SLS printing likely is not viable.
Nylon Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) has not been shown to be an acceptable method of 3D printing for two reasons. First, nylon absorbs water from the atmosphere rapidly over time which will degrade the tourniquet and SLS may negate any tensile strength advantages that nylon has over other approved materials. Second, SLS printers are expensive and not likely to be available in low-resource environments rendering this process impractical. In high-resource environments where such machines are available it is likely more cost effective to pursue injection molding rather than SLS printing.
