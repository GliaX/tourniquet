# Tourniquet Quality Control

Our [Design Intent](design_intent.md) document covers the reason for the specific design of our tourniquet parts. Please read this document before printing the parts.

There are several tools available for Quality Assurance of the manufactured tourniquet.

**Backplate Tester**

The [Backplate Tester](TQ_backplate_tester.STL) has been developed in order to test the backplates as they come off of the 3D printer bed. This is because of breakage that can be common when printing this part. Please see the [Backplate Breakage Report](Backplate_Breakage_Report.pdf), which talks about this issue, and also shows how to use the backplate tester.

**Strap Spacer**

The [Strap Spacer](strap_spacer.stl) is a tool that can be used in order to ensure the inner strap has the correct slack needed when assembling and sewing the tourniquet together.

The material and printing settings do not matter as long as the dimensions of the spacer are accurate.
This part is a tool, not an integral element of the tourniquet and does not need to meet the rigidity requirements of the windlass, backplate, buckle or clip.

Please see #10 in the [Assembly Instructions](tourniquet/assembly_instructions) for instructions on how to you the strap spacer when manufacturing the tourniquet.

**QA Chart and Checklist**

The Tourniquet [QA Chart](tourniquet_QA_Chart.pdf) and [QC Checklist](tourniquet_QC_checklist_x2.pdf) are tools to be used when conducting a quality assurance check on the finished manufactured tourniquet. These tools ensure that all the details are given attention to check if they adhere to the manufacturing specifications in the assembly instructions, and that the device will function properly when used.

**Measuring Tool**

The [Tourniquet Measuring Tool](tourniquet_measuring_tool.pdf) can be used when conducting the quality assurance of each manufactured device. This is a simple device printed on paper that can help with the QA process in terms of quickly checking that 3 important measurements are correct:

1. the distance from the rounded end of strap to the closest edge of the box stitch (30mm)
2. the amount of slack on the inner strap (25mm)
3. the distance from the bridge of the backplate to the stitch holding the buckle to the strap (35mm)
