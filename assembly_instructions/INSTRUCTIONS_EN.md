# Assembly Instructions
1. Cut all the strapping, hook and loop to the required lengths specified in the table below:

|Material|Quantity|Length|
|:--------------------------------------|:-------------------------|:-------------------------|
|Black Non-Adhesive Hook 4 cm wide|3|6cm|
|Black Non-Adhesive Hook 4 cm wide|1|15cm|
|Black Non-Adhesive Loop 4 cm wide|1|6cm|
|Black Non-Adhesive Loop 4 cm wide|2|12.5cm|
|Black Non-Adhesive Loop 4 cm wide|1|19cm|
|Polyester Grosgrain Strap 4 cm wide|1|92cm|
|Nylon Heavy Webbing Strap 2 cm wide|1|95cm|
|Adhesive Hook 2 cm wide|1|16cm|
|White Non-Adhesive Loop 2 cm wide|1|17cm|

*Please keep in mind, the Polyester Cotton Webbing Strap in the above graphic, is actually the Polyester Grosgrain Ribbon in the table above the graphic. It's referenced at the lengths in the table due to the Canada office wanting zero waste of the strapping, or as little as possible. The graphic has both inner and outer strapping at 97cm, which works, but may have some excess strap to trim. it's probably safer to start with 97cm for initial device.*

2. For the front face of the belt, begin by placing the Hook and Loop in order of how they will be sewn together. The first piece to sew is the 6cm Loop to the 6cm Hook at the rounded end of the belt.

|:-------------------------|

3. Sew pieces together sequentially in a cascading pattern by placing the edge of each piece above the edge of the next piece and then sewing across them along the seam a couple of times with a zigzag stitch. This type of assembly increases tensile strength, and facilitates a smooth pull through the buckle.

4. Sew the polyester grosgrain strap (3.8cm wide) to the Hook and Loop assembly just sewn, making sure that the Hook and Loop is facing outward. Sew one long side only and leave the other side free to insert the internal belt. (For alternative method of inserting internal belt, please see Addendum at the bottom of these Tourniquet Assembly Instructions.)

</p>

8. Insert only the internal belt through the slot in the 3d-printed windlass rod.

<p align="center">

</p>

9. Then insert the internal and external belts through the slot on the back plate, ensuring the orientation of the back plate is 15mm under the 15cm hook piece (see photo at step 12).

<p align="center">
<img src="../assets/instructions/fig11.jpg" width="600" height="500" alt="Fig11">
</p>

10. With the windlass in place, pull the internal belt up to 25 mm above the backing plate.

</p>

The [Strap Spacer](https://github.com/GliaX/tourniquet/blob/master/quality_control/strap_spacer.stl), found in the [quality_control](https://github.com/GliaX/tourniquet/blob/master/quality_control) folder, is a tool that can be used in order to ensure the inner strap has the correct slack needed.

<p align="center">
<img src="../assets/instructions/fig1_spacer.jpg" width="600" height="700" alt"strap_spacer")
</p>

Insert the spacer under the inner strap with the slope side of the triangle facing away from the bridge of the backplate.
The windlass should be placed on top of the backplate, with the windlass hole facing upwards, between the bridge of the backplate and the spacer. 

The spacer should be flat on the outer strap. Pull the inner strap tight with the spacer in place, and this will set the appropriate slack of the inner strap. 

11. Insert the free end of the belts (both internal and external) through the toothless slot of the 3D printed buckle. Fold over and sew both internal and external belts to themselves 35 mm from the bridge of the back plate. **Back plate should be positioned 15mm under the 15cm hook piece (see step 12).**

|![Fig13](../assets/instructions/fig13.png)|![Fig14](../assets/instructions/fig14.png)|
|:--------------------------------------|:-------------------------|


12. Position edge of back plate under the piece of hook by 15 mm.

|![Fig15](../assets/instructions/fig15.png)|
|:-------------------------|

13. Punch two holes through the external belt only **(avoid the internal belt)** where the holes are located on the back plate to mount it to the belt. Use a 7 mm head double cap rivet to fasten the back plate to the belt.

|![Fig16](../assets/instructions/fig16.jpg)|![Fig17](../assets/instructions/fig17.jpg)|
|:--------------------------------------|:-------------------------|


14. Put the clip onto the belt. The clip is positioned so that the open end is always pointing toward the long end of the belt, **capped end toward the buckle**. Slide the 3D printed clip onto the belt by 	putting the belt down through slot 1 and up through slot 2, as shown below. Pull the clip along 	length of belt until it reaches the back plate and the belt is taught.

|![Fig18](../assets/instructions/fig18.png)|![Fig19](../assets/instructions/fig19.png)|
|:--------------------------------------|:-------------------------|


15. To sew the Hoop and Loop assembly to be adhered to the clip, sew the end of the white non-adhesive Loop (face down) to the centre point of adhesive Hook (face up / black in the photo below).

<p align="center">
<img src="../assets/instructions/fig20.jpg" width="600" height="700" alt="Fig20">
</p>

16. Adhere the Hook to the clip (Hook is black in the photos). **Use Cyanoacrylate (Super Glue) to permanently stick this piece onto clip if clip is printed with ABS. Use 90 second epoxy adhesive to stick if clip is printed in PETG.** Glue is applied as a dab under the open ends of the clip to glue the folded over ends of the Hook piece. Loop piece is free to wrap over top.

|:--------------------------------------|:-------------------------|


17. To prepare for folding, position the white Loop piece same as in the photos below.

|![Fig23](../assets/instructions/fig23.png)|![Fig24](../assets/instructions/fig24.png)|
|:--------------------------------------|:-------------------------|


18. Completed tourniquet, folded and ready for packaging. See folding video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSECJQPJmLw)

|![Fig25](../assets/instructions/fig25.jpg)|
|:-------------------------|

*Note: You can use one Omni tape for the long belt instead of using separate parts of hook and loop (Velcro).*

# Troubleshooting
1. If you find it difficult to sew the velcro tapes together, first stick them onto a long piece of masking tape, then sew. Rip off the masking tape when done.  

2. Always make sure the internal belt is free to move after anchoring it at both ends. When turning the windlass, the internal belt should tighten.

3. The rivets should only be through the outer strapping. Make sure they are not through, or pinching, the internal belt.
  
4. Make sure the capped end of the clip is facing toward the buckle. This helps secure the windlass in place once it is turned to the appropriate tightness.
# Addendum
1) **Alternative Inner Belt Insertion**
<p>
*An alternative method of inserting the internal belt into the external belt (covering steps #4, 5, 6 and 7 in the Tourniquet Assembly Instructions).*

1(a). Sew the Hook and Loop belt to the 4cm external strapping down both long sides leaving both short ends open. This creates a tube in which the internal belt can be inserted into.

|![Fig26](../assets/instructions/fig26.jpg)|![Fig27](../assets/instructions/fig27.jpg)|
|:--------------------------------------|:-------------------------|

1(b). Secure one end of the internal belt to one end of a rod that is the same length (or longer) than the internal belt.

|![Fig28](../assets/instructions/fig28.jpg)|
|:-------------------------|
1(c). Insert that end into the external belt all the way until it comes out the other end. Then take the rod out leaving the internal belt inside the external belt.

|![Fig29](../assets/instructions/fig29.jpg)|![Fig30](../assets/instructions/fig30.jpg)|
|:--------------------------------------|:-------------------------|

1(d). Sew across the internal and external belts with a straight stitch 3 cm from the end with the small Loop piece, anchoring the internal belt between both sides of the external belt, as in step #5 of the Tourniquet Assembly Instructions.

1(e). Continue with step #6 of the instructions, sewing a box stitch 5 cm from end (2 cm from straight stitch across belts), then cut end round and sew around the cut edge. Carefully burn off frayed edge of belt.

1(f). Skip step #7, and continue on with step #8 of the Tourniquet Assembly	Instructions.
